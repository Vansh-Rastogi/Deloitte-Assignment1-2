setInterval()
-------------
It calls a function at specified intervals (in milliseconds). It continues calling the function until clearInterval() is called, or the window is closed.

setTimeout()
------------
It calls a function after a number of milliseconds. It is executed only once.

Promises
--------
The Promise Object represents the completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its results. It has 3 states, pending, rejected, fulfilled. 
Promises are used to simplify managing multiple asynchronous operations, preventing callback hell and unmanageable code. They represent future values, associating 
handlers with eventual success or failure, resembling synchronous methods by postponing value delivery.
